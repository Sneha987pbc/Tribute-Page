                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam ; (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015)

                was an Indian aerospace scientist<br> and statesman who served as the 11th
                President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram,<br>
                Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
                He spent the next four decades as a scientist and <br>science administrator,
                mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and
                Indian Space Research <br>Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved

                in India's civilian space programme and military missile <br>development efforts. He thus came to b
                known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of <br>ballistic missile and launch
                vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,<br> and political role in
                India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since <br>the original nuclear test by India in 1974
